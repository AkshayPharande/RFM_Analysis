7: almost 50% customers are spend time and buy products and around 25-30% customers are potential customers and 20-25% customers need attention.

Suggestions
I. Based on the above R-F-M score, we can give some Recommendations.
1: Champions: We can Reward them for their multiples purchases. They can be early adopters to very new products. Suggest them “Refer a friend”. Also, they can be the most loyal customers that have the habit to order.
2: Potential customers: Create loyalty cards in which they can gain points each time of purchasing and these points could transfer into a discount
3: Need attention: Send them personalized emails/messages/notifications to encourage them to order. Also Notify them about the discounts to keep them spending more and more money on your products.
II. Based On the visualization of data :
1. Allow discounts on products at the beginning of the month so that customers can start spending from week one..
2. Take survey from need attention customers about service, offers and what they required from us.
